# DICOM-GPT Conversion: An AI-Assisted Tool for Analyzing MS Lesions in MRI Scans

## Welcome to the DICOM-GPT Conversion Tool
This Python-based tool enhances the analysis of MRI DICOM files, enabling automated lesion identification and a high-level interpretive report for patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). By converting MRI DICOM images into a format interpretable by AI models, such as OpenAI's ChatGPT, it provides personalized insights into lesion location and potential neurological impacts, making it a valuable aid for both patients and healthcare professionals.

## Purpose
DICOM-GPT Conversion is designed to bridge the gap between complex MRI data and accessible AI-assisted interpretations. By parsing MRI DICOM files, designed particularly for patients with multiple sclerosis, the tool extracts relevant images (e.g., those showing gadolinium-enhancing lesions) and converts them into a format that AI models can analyze. The goal is to simplify the process of identifying lesion locations and correlating them with functional deficits, potentially aiding neurologists in patient discussions and prognosis.
The initiative seeks to transform the use and accessibility of MRI in the field of neurological healthcare, emphasizing three key goals:
<ol>
<li><strong>Identifying Lesions and Isolating Potential Deficits:</strong>
<p>MRI is a powerful tool in diagnosing and monitoring neurological conditioans by detecting lesions and structural abnormalities in the brain and spinal cord. By leveraging advanced imaging techniques, we aim to more precisely identify the location, size, and activity of lesions, enabling a better understanding of their correlation with neurological deficits. This will allow clinicians to pinpoint areas of potential cognitive, sensory, or motor impairment, tailoring treatments more effectively to individual patients.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Making MRI More Accessible to the Public:</strong>
<p>Access to MRI is often limited by high costs and geographic barriers, preventing timely diagnosis and intervention for many patients. We aim to reduce these barriers by promoting partnerships with healthcare providers, developing affordable options, and advocating for broader insurance coverage and public funding. This will democratize access to critical imaging technologies, ensuring that individuals across diverse socioeconomic backgrounds can benefit from early detection and personalized treatment strategies.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Supporting ProsperNova's NeuroGenius Application for Functional Recovery:</strong>
<p>NeuroGenius is an innovative platform within ProsperNova that seeks to leverage fMRI and neurofeedback to promote targeted remyelination of affected lesions, going beyond traditional therapeutic outcomes. By using real-time neurofeedback, the application allows patients to interactively engage in neuroplasticity exercises, aimed at regenerating myelin in specific damaged areas. This targeted approach has the potential to enhance functional recovery after neurodegeneration, with the ultimate goal of achieving measurable improvements that can be confirmed by follow-up MRI scans. The integration of fMRI into NeuroGenius will offer unprecedented insights into both therapeutic progress and the physiological basis of functional recovery.</p>
</li>
</ol>
DICOM-Gpt-Conversion was originally based off of our MRI lesion-targetting system used in the active development of <a href="https://github.com/ProsperNova/NeuroGenius">NeuroGenius</a>. In the future, this software will, upon mapping lesions, output the possible deficits, and ask patients which lesion they wish to target using our remylination platform, which combines different forms of neurofeedback to attempt stimulated memyelination acrosss specific, targetted lesions.

## Features
<ul>
  <li>Cross-Platform Compatibility: Designed to run on any system that supports Python.</li>
  <li>Simple to Use: Easy to set up and run with minimal configuration.</li>
  <li>Efficient Conversion: Converts bulky DICOM files into manageable PNG or JPEG images.</li>
  <li>Focused Analysis: Specifically processes T2 and FLAIR sequences to identify Gd-enhanced lesions.</li>
</ul>

## Installation
Use the following guide to install, with the only prerequisite being Python. We're assuming you have some pre-requisite Python experience, which would make the experience much more seemless. With that said, the following steps have been tested in Windows, Linux (Ubuntu, Debian, CentOS, RHL), and macOS with ```brew``` already set up and configured.
<ol>
<li>Download the source code from this repo using the web interface, or clone to your computer using ```gh``` as follows:
```Cli
gh repo clone ProsperNova/DICOM-Gpt-Conversion
~~~
</li>
<li>Using python's pip, run the following command:
```Cli
pip install pydicom numpy matplotlib
```
This installs the following libraries for your python environment, and which the script depends on:
<ul>
<li><strong>pydicom</strong> for working with DICOM files.</li>
<li><strong>numpy</strong> for numerical computations.</li>
<li><strong>matplotlib</strong> for plotting and image visualization, including saving images with imsave.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
## Using ```dicom-gpt-conversion.py```
### Converting DICOM files
<ol>
<li>Extract the DICOM ZIP file, and find the relevant directory (```/dicom``` usually)</li>
<li>Create a destination directory (i.e. ```~/Documents/dicom-for-gpt```)</li>
<li>Make sure your terminal is pointed at the same folder as ```dicom_gpt_conversion.py```, and, using absolute paths for --input-drectory and --output-directory, run ```dicom_gpt_conversion.py --input_directory "dir" ----output_directory "dir"```
<li>ZIP the folder "output_directory" and upload it to your favorite AI!</li>
</ol>
### Tested Questions to use with the file:
`Help me identify lesions associated with [disease] and help me identify potential deficits`
`Given the specific deficits you noted, suggest activities that could help recover lost functionality`
`What treatment methods are thought to be most successful given my MRI history?`

<hr><p>This tool, used in combination with ChatGPT for explanation and interpretation, may significantly assist clinicians and patients in understanding MRI findings across a wide range of conditions. This could easily be fine-tuned using privately-trained AIs like <a href="https://llama.meta.com/docs/llama-everywhere">Meta's LLaMa</a> and, while susceptible to potentially misleading results, thus far DICOM-GPT has worked quite well.</p>

## Results
Thus far, our testing has been validated by patient-reported deficits which are 1.) not reported to the AI,  but 2.) are confirmed by the AI, based only on interpretation of MRI data from DICOM-Gpt-conversion-generated files.
